					<a href="http://www.venatrack.com/">Venatrack LTD</a>
				</h3>Remote (Offices in Slough)<br>
			    September 2010 - January 2013<br>
			    Senior developer<br>
			</div>
			<p>I worked at Venatrack on several components of their Motion Capture system which recorded football matches from a number of cameras using different software for a variety of stages of the production, both live software and post-production.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I was involved in re-writing the c++ rendering engine for our 3D-clip production software to move from FixedFunction code (DirectX 9) to a more powerful and flexible system (using DirectX 11) which allowed us to add a large number of effects and render much more higher-resolution geometry (collada) whilst still being efficient and allowing us to produce video clips of the 3D renders.</li>
	<li>Writing HLSL shader effects such as depth of field, realtime shadows, and other post-processing pixel shader effects to go with geometry-effects such as large volume rendering of crowd members (all on GPU)</li>
	<li>As the different cluster components developed I introduced new systems and classes specifically to aid optimising the c++ multithreaded software, identifying slow code, removing contention between threads and increasing concurrency on 16 core machines.</li>
<li>I refactored and improved much of our core C++ API, used on the truck software and our various tools, introducing Unit Tests and identifying(and fixing) many bugs with these core classes which improved stability</li>
	<li>Much of our C++ software needed to be administrated live under tense conditions so most components had a PHP Web interface with a custom-written C++ HTTP server. This not only needed to be efficient but cross-browser safe (including tablets and mobiles) and implement protocols correctly.</li>
	<li>We had proprietry database and file formats to store gigabytes of data so we often needed specific C++ tools to convert, view and manage these assets which needed to run fast and work with 3gb+ files.</li>
	<li>Much of these video tools needed realtime conversion for other flash or HTML based tools (both live and post-production) and to facilitate operators often had a web-interface to interact with the executables on remote machines. These were often written in PHP on a WAMP server to execute these tools and monitor their progress.</li>
	<li>To evaluate the improving quality of our software, we had various tools to evaluate certain aspects of the software (eg. OCR or Team-kit recognition). Using Teamcity I wrote various scripts in Python to compare the XML output of these tools to automatically produce HTML graphs so we could see improves per-commit.</li>

			    technology and tools with scalability in
			    mind and looking to expand in the future
			    back onto consoles. We released a few small games into the AppStore whilst we worked on a much larger project, but this never came to fruition before our funds ran out.
			</p>


<p>Most of the work was in c++ for cross-platform purposes, with objective-c for IOS specific interfacing.</p>
<p>Tootle has ended as of October 2009 as we have run out of bootstrap funding.</p>

				    Self employed web/application
				    development
				</h3>1998 - Present<br>
			    Developer/designer<br>
			</div>
			<p>
			    I have produced web sites, backends, Content management systems and e-commerce systems on a contract
			    basis. I have a long standing experience with web-based
			    technologies and standards compliance. I
			    also have been involved in graphics
			    production including creating logos and
			    brands and whole site designs and user
			    interfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Most of my web-based work is personal;
			    experiments with technologies, integration
			    into non-web based (console) games.
			</p>

			<p>
			    Whilst I am a competent designer most live
			    examples are more technical achievements
			    rather than examples of design. Often I am
			    asked to implement a design from
			    drawings/images or add dynamic
			    functionality to an existing site and not
			    change the design.
			</p>

			<p class="ListTitle">
			   Skills used:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Worked with PHP, XML, XSLT, Perl, Python, JScript/Javascript, Wordpress and more</li>
				<li>Dynamic image and flash animation manipulation</li>
				<li>AJAX based dynamic pages</li>
				<li>SQL and XML based database interfacing and management</li>
				<li>RSS management and manipulation</li>
				<li>Simple standards based CSS and XHTML sites</li>
				<li>Larger re-usable CMS systems with simple automated interfaces to databases where websites could be constructed from XML</li>
				<li>Negotiating and liaising with clients and other contractors</li>
